# Pre-course Material

**Introduction and chapter 1 + 2** from http://uppnex.se/unixtut/

You must use http://bellard.org/jslinux/ to try the commands in the tutorial, otherwise the commands will not work. If you any questions regarding this tutorial contact: martin.dahlo@scilifelab.uu.se

Using Linux is often the hardest part of the course, so being familiar with writing things on a command-line will help. **You should at least go through the exercises in the tutorial, no need to know it by heart.**
