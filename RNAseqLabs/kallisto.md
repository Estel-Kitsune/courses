#Kallisto (Beta format)
Kallisto is a "mapping free" RNAseq quantification method that runs very fast with a small memory footprint. It is a command-line program that can be downloaded as binary executables for Linux or Mac, or in source code format. For a first insight in the program, read [here](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/near-optimal-rna-seq-quantification-with-kallisto/) and for the preprint [article](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/near-optimal-rna-seq-quantification-with-kallisto/).

*Sleuth* is ...

This is just now showing you the steps for how to run kallisto. More documentation will be added later when we know for sure this is a good method for RNAseq downstream analysis. (We are currently benchmarking it!)
