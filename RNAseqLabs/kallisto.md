#Kallisto (Beta format)
Kallisto is a map free RNAseq quantification method that runs very fast and requires very little memory and creates new optimal results. 

For a first insight in the program reads [here](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/near-optimal-rna-seq-quantification-with-kallisto/) and for the preprint [article](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/near-optimal-rna-seq-quantification-with-kallisto/)

This is just now showing you the steps for how to run calisto. More documentation will be added later when we know for sure this is a good method for RNAseq downstream analysis.
